### Upstream configuration for PHP FastCGI.

## Add as many servers as needed:
## Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
## Note that this configuration assumes by default that keepalive
## upstream connections are supported and that you have a Nginx
## version with the fair load balancer.

## Add as many servers as needed. Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
upstream phpcgi {
    ## Use the least connection algorithm for load balancing. This
    ## algorithm was introduced in versions 1.3.1 and 1.2.2.
    least_conn;

    server unix:/var/run/php-fpm.sock;
    server unix:/var/run/php-fpm-zwei.sock;
    ## Create a backend connection cache. Note that this requires
    ## Nginx version greater or equal to 1.1.4.
    ## Cf. http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES. Comment out the following
    ## line if that's not the case.
    keepalive 5;
}

## Demo upstream for example.com vhost
upstream phpcgi_examplecom {
  least_conn;
  server unix:/var/run/php-fpm-examplecom.sock;
  keepalive 5;
}

## Add a third pool as a fallback. Note that this requires php-cgi
## side by side php-fpm. If you don't have it installed comment it
## out.
upstream phpcgi_backup {
    server unix:/var/run/php-fpm-bkp.sock;
    ## Create a backend connection cache. Note that this requires
    ## Nginx version greater or equal to 1.1.4.
    ## Cf. http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES. Comment out the
    ## following line if that's not the case.
    keepalive 1;
}

## The upstreams below are used only for monitoring php-fpm status,

## The PHP TCP upstream that corresponds to the first pool: www0.
upstream www0 {
    server unix:/var/run/php-fpm.sock;
}

## The PHP TCP upstream that corresponds to the second pool: www1.
upstream www1 {
    server unix:/var/run/php-fpm-zwei.sock;
}
